Paul:

impressions:
- overall workload was okay most people finished pretty fast

suggested changes:
- change to only use torch as an import otherwise students are confused where nn and F come from (write torch.nn.Linear and torch.nn.functional.relu instead)
- mention a bit more batching in the beginning of the tutorial since I think it could help for additional tasks where people get confusde about this 
- add a task to the first section e.g. calling backward since students were sometimes a bit confused about this how the magic happpens (just let them do it and see how the gradients are stored after that)
- maybe even double check the gradients with finite difference in the first toy example for fun
